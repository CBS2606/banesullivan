Examples
========

There are tons of excellent examples in `PyVista's gallery <https://docs.pyvista.org/examples/index.html>`_,
but here are some additional examples more geared towards geoscientists.

Many of these examples have made their way into the main PyVista docs, but I still host them here to have a complete list of geoscientific examples.

Please feel free to use and extend these examples. I simply ask that you please give me and the PyVista Developers a shout out / some form of acknowledgment ;)
